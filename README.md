# Capstone Project Movie Recommendation System
Capstone Project
Abstract
COVID-19 changes the people lifestyle, due to the lockdown at home, the internet usages are increased, and it impacts on the social life. According to Forbes the initial internet hits increased by between 50% and 70%. Entertainment sites like Netflix, Facebook usages also jumped by 12% approximately.
Considering these changes, Recommendation systems are becoming particularly important in media industry as well as online consumer world. People always prefer to see the items/movies based on their previous search into the system. My project will focus on develop the recommendation system which will help individual to search for content that would be interesting to him/her based on algorithms that sort out all possible choices and create a customize lists of items for that individual.
The dataset I choose for this project is from GroupLens research lab in the University of Minnesota and available in the MovieLens website which contains four files such as movies.csv, ratings.csv, links.csv and tags.csv. The goal of this project is to give a better understanding of User Based Collaborative Filter (UBCF) and Item Based Collaborative Filter (IBCF) models for hybrid recommender systems by answering the following question:

•	With what level of performance can collaborative filtering using UBCF and IBCF models produce movie recommendations based on movies and user’s ratings data?
